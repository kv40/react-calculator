# React Calculator

This is a calculator application booststrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project was meant to serve as an introduction to using React and to teach me the principles of React and its' components. It uses a mix of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A live demo of this project can be seen at [this link](https://kv40.github.io/react-calculator/).

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now includes [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
Run the following commands after the installation procedure to verify installation.

    $ node --version
    v12.11.1

    $ npm --version
    6.11.3

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/kv40/react-calculator.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install

## Contributing

I used [this blog](https://blog.usejournal.com/everything-react-first-app-188b33a880ca) by Danyal Imran as a guide for creating this calculator application.
